# Call-stack
# Task
A stack of bricks that is too high may collapse. Hence, in real life, when the height of the stack would exceed some threshold value, we would start stacking bricks into a new stack. Implement a data structure that mimics the real life situation. The structure should consist of multiple stacks, a new stack is created as soon as the previous stack reaches a threshold value. The methods should behave the same way as when working with a single stack Implement a function that performs a pop operation on a given internal stack.

Develop a graphical interface for the program. Add the ability to add bricks to the stack, create stacks manually, and remove bricks from the stack. Be sure to include a count of bricks added and how many bricks are in which stack.
